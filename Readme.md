# SBT Git Hooks

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/randomcoder/sbt-git-hooks.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/randomcoder/sbt-git-hooks)

`git-hooks` directory into `$(git rev-parse --git-path hooks)` (or different configured directories) and
ensure they are executable.

the hooks that are available.
